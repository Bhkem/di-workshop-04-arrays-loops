# Workshop 4 - Arrays & Loops

You’ll be working in pairs again - **driver/navigator** style, same as before.
Start by setting up the workshop as usual.

For each of the **bold** questions below:

<h3 align="center">
  🗣 Discuss &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  👩‍💻 Change &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  👀 Observe &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  🔄 Repeat
</h3>

1. **🗣 Discuss** the question with your partner
1. **👩‍💻 Change the code** - what do you expect your changes to do?
1. **👀 Observe the results** - what happened when you ran your code? How did it
   differ from your expectations
1. **🔄 Repeat** - keep discussing, changing, and running the code until you
   feel you understand it

**Remember, it’s about exploration and understanding. Take your time!**

**Don’t move on until you fully understand what’s happening.**
